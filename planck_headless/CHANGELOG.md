# Changelog

## v0.1.0

First release.

### Session lifecycle

- `Planck.Headless.start_session/1` — resolves team (alias, path, or nil for
  the default dynamic team), generates a `<adjective>-<noun>` session name,
  starts `Planck.Agent.Session`, materialises agents with built-in + external
  tools and resolved skills, saves metadata (`team_id`, `team_alias`, `cwd`,
  `session_name`) to SQLite.
- `Planck.Headless.resume_session/1` — accepts session id or name, reopens the
  SQLite session, reconstructs the base team from metadata, replays completed
  `spawn_agent` calls from the previous orchestrator's history to restore
  dynamically-added workers (deduped by `{type, name}` against the base team,
  so two builders "Bob" and "Charlie" are both correctly reconstructed),
  detects in-flight `ask_agent` and unfinished workers, injects a recovery
  context message under the new orchestrator if anything was in-flight.
- `Planck.Headless.close_session/1` — stops all agents by `team_id`, stops the
  Session GenServer; SQLite file retained.
- `Planck.Headless.prompt/2` — dispatches to the orchestrator via the agent
  registry (`team_id` is read from session metadata; no separate tracker).
- `Planck.Headless.list_sessions/0` — globs sessions dir for `<id>_<name>.db`
  files; checks `Session.whereis/1` for active status.
- `Planck.Headless.list_teams/0`, `get_team/1` — wrap `ResourceStore`.
- `Planck.Headless.available_models/0`, `reload_resources/0`.

### Team materialization

- Orchestrators receive all four `BuiltinTools` (read, write, edit, bash) in
  their `tool_pool` so spec.tools names like `"read"` resolve correctly.
- `orchestrator_tools` + `worker_tools` injected on top of resolved spec tools;
  workers get `worker_tools` only (no spawn_agent etc.).
- Default dynamic team: orchestrator's `base_url` pulled from
  `ResourceStore.available_models` so local servers use the correct URL.

### Config

- `Planck.Headless.Config.JsonBinding` — Skogsra `Binding` that reads
  `~/.planck/config.json` and `.planck/config.json` at resolution time; results
  cached in persistent_term; `invalidate/0` for cache busting before reload.
- `config_files` app_env (`PLANCK_CONFIG_FILES`) — controls which JSON files
  are read; `config :planck_headless, :skip_json_config, true` for tests.
- `models` app_env — `Planck.AI.Config`-format model declarations parsed to
  `[Planck.AI.Model.t()]`; replaces `local_servers`; no network at boot.
- Provider atoms pre-loaded at boot via `Planck.AI.Model.providers()` to avoid
  `String.to_existing_atom` failures on lazy module load.
- `PathList` inline as `Planck.Headless.Config.PathList` submodule.

### ResourceStore

- Cloud models: static LLMDB catalog filtered by API key presence.
- Local/custom models: from `Config.models!()` — already parsed, zero network.
- `AppSupervisor` owns `ResourceStore`; no `SessionRegistry` — dropped in
  favour of reading `team_id` directly from session SQLite metadata.

### Session naming

- `Planck.Headless.SessionName` — generates `<adjective>-<noun>` names;
  `generate/1` retries on collision; `sanitize/1` normalises to `[a-z0-9-]+`.
- Session files stored as `<sessions_dir>/<id>_<name>.db`;
  `Session.find_by_id/2` and `find_by_name/2` use glob for O(1) lookup.

### Other

- `Planck.Headless.DefaultPrompt` — default system prompt for dynamic-team
  orchestrator.
- `Mox` in test deps; `Planck.Agent.MockAI` wired in test.exs.
- `start_session(template: alias)` exercised via ResourceStore in tests.
- Fixed in-flight detection and completed spawn_agent matching to use
  `MapSet.member?/2` instead of `is_map_key/2` guard (MapSet is a struct,
  not a plain map; the guard silently never matched).
